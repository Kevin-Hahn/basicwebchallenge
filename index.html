      <p>
        Welcome to your little challenge. Please open the CHALLENGE.md file to
        the left and start with the first topic.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can use all resources you have to finish this challenge (except
        letting others write this code for you). So feel free to google or ask,
        whenever a question arise.
      </p>

      <p>
        Also think aloud. The thought process is also very important to hear and
        it helps us helping you, when you are stuck.
